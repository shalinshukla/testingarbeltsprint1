                <h2 class="title-word"><span>Our History</span></h2>
                <div class="body">
                  <p>The silica mining and processing operation was first set up at the current location in 1981 by Mountain Minerals Limited near the town of Golden, British Columbia.  Since that time the mining and processing methods have remained relatively unchanged. Tonnages quarried and processed have varied between 80,000 and 300,000tpa.</p>
                  <img src="../assets/images/ns-img1.jpg" alt="Image" />
                  <p>A rail siding off the Canadian Pacific Railroad main line, which runs between the Trans-Canada Highway and the processing plant, was built in the 1980s. During most of the time of operation, the main customer for the silica sand was Owens Illinois, who had a glass bottle manufacturing plant at Lavington, BC.  Due to the high concentration of SiO2 at the Moberly mine the high quality silica made Mountain Minerals a key supplier for the glass manufacturing plant. Other small volume sales were made for golf course sand, decorative stone, traffic paint and the like.</p>
                  <p>Heemskirk purchased Mountain Minerals Moberly from Dynatec in 2005 including the processing plant site.   At the time of purchase of the Canadian business, the Company recognised two critical factors in relation to Moberly.  First, the silica mineralisation was both exceptionally pure and large in volume.  Second, given the quality, the silica was noted to have enormous strategic importance in the North American, and more particularly Western Canadian, context.</p>
                  <p>In 2008 the plant was modified by adding a grind ‘circuit to produce silica flour’ (minus 325 mesh silica) used predominantly in high quality thermal cements.  Later in 2008, Owens Illinois announced the closure of their bottle making plant at Lavington BC and hence cancelled the contract with Mountain Minerals.  Since then, the silica flour plant has continued to operate and the silica sand circuit has operated subject to demand.</p>
                  <p>Heemskirk began tests in 2010 on existing Run of Mine silica stockpiles to evaluate the Product suitability for use as proppant.  A series of tests, mainly involving variations in crushing and grinding treatments on silica  feed-stocks resulted in sands of industry standard size gradations of 20/40 mesh, 40/70 mesh and 70/140 mesh size ranges being produced and able to pass the API/ ISO tests for  proppants.</p>
                  <p>In 2014 Heemskirk negotiated a debt funding package for the redevelopment of the Moberly Processing plant and upgrade of mine works. The financing was funded by Taurus Resources Fund T2 fund located in Sydney, Australia. The Moberly redevelopment construction started shortly thereafter and was completed in August 2017. On December 9, 2016 Taurus made an offer to buy the public listed company shares of Heemskirk Consolidated and take the company private along with other large long term investors. They completed the transaction on June 30, 2017. Taurus setup a private incorporated company in Alberta, Canada know as Northern Silica Corporation.</p>
                  <p>Today Northern Silica Corporation owns and operates the Moberly mine that will again produce high grade silica products for its customers in North America and look as other overseas markets for expansion.</p>
